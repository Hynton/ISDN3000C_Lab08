    "# Lab 08: Black Box AI - Neural Networks & Computer Vision\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lab 07, we used models like Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost to predict the state of a piece of toast (`Under-done`, `Perfect`, `Burnt`) based on structured data (e.g., `ToastingTime`, `BreadThickness`).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we then go further into \"Black Box\" AI—specifically, **Neural Networks**. For details please check the lecture slides.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will:\n",
    "1.  **Apply a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** to our familiar Lab 07 \"toaster\" dataset.\n",
    "2.  **Build a simple MLP from scratch** using NumPy to understand its inner workings (feedforward, backpropagation).\n",
    "3.  **Use a pre-trained YOLO model**, a powerful Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to perform real-time object detection on images, e.g. \"Can it find a toaster?\"\n",
    "4.  **Final Challenge: Build and optimize your own CNN** to solve a new image classification problem: detecting food on a real dataset!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission\n",
    "1.  This is a **group assignment**. One submission per group.\n",
    "2.  You can work in **Google Colab** or **locally** (recommended) .\n",
    "3.  Complete all tasks in this notebook.\n",
    "4.  For the **Final Challenge**, you must finish the first report and run the cells to generate `txt` format reports. Fill in and generate report 2 and 3 only if you choose to do optional job step 3.5.\n",
    "5.  Submit forked Github repository link to canvas."
